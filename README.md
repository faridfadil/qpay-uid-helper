# QPay Student ID Helper 
**Original Script by Vinh The Nguyen **

## About 
QPay event attendee lists do not have a Student ID
associated with them which makes the process of reimbursement a pain in the ass. So Vinh has written a script to automate this process by taking the 
CSV from a club's membership list and cross referencing the event attendee list with the membership list to output a file containing the Student IDs
of all attendees from the club. 

Long story short, "ooga booga no student ID in event list? No problem, lemme take them from the membership list and slap 
it on the event list" - The script probably. 

## My Implementation 
After a bug was found in the original script, Vinh and I worked together to fix it. Furthermore, the original script did not have a user interface so 
the input fields had to be manually filled out in code. I wish for this script to be used by future executives regardless of coding experience. Hence, 
my implementation focuses more on the front end side of the application- adding a GUI and easy to read file import systems.
